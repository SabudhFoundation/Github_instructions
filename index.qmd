## Instructions for Students

To bring uniformity in monitoring your coding progress and team collaboration, we will be using **GitHub Classroom** for the Passion Project. Follow the steps below carefully to set up your repository and start working as a team:

### ✅ Getting Started

1. **Create a GitHub Account**  
   Ensure every team member has an active GitHub account. If not, sign up at [https://github.com](https://github.com).

2. **Join the Assignment**  
   The on this link to access the GitHub Classroom assignment will be sent via email to you:  
   🔗 [https://classroom.github.com/](https://classroom.github.com/)  
   Then click **"Accept this assignment"**.

3. **Form or Join a Team (Responsibility Project Group Student Leader)**
   - If your team already exists, **select it** from the list.
   - If not, one member (ideally the **project lead**) should click on **"Create a new team"** and name it sensibly, reflecting your Passion Project’s title. Encouraged to use of clear, consistent naming and connected with `_` (e.g., `Traffic_Flow_Prediction`, `Crop_Yield_Predictor`, `Gait_Analyzer`, etc.).
   - All other team members will join the newly created team (No separate project will be created).

### 💻 Setting Up the Repository

4. **Repository Creation**
   - Once the team is set, GitHub will automatically generate a **private repository** for your project.
   - Each member must **clone** this repository to their local system:
     - Go to the repo homepage.
     - Click the green **"Code"** button.
     - You will see two options: **HTTPS** and **SSH**.

## Option A: Clone via HTTPS 

- It simpler but requires login everytime
  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourOrganization/your-repo-name.git
```

## Option B: Clone via SSH 

- It is recommended for frequent users, like you.
  
Steps to set up SSH:

i. Open your terminal and generate a new SSH key:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```
ii. Press Enter to accept the default file location.

iii. Add the SSH key to the ssh-agent:

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```
iv. Copy the SSH key to your clipboard:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```
v. Go to GitHub > Settings > SSH and GPG keys > New SSH key.

vi. Paste your key and give it a title (e.g., “My Laptop”).

vii. Now you can clone using:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:YourOrganization/your-repo-name.git
```

5. **Project Directory & Report**
   - A predefined **directory structure** is provided in the repository. This **must be used** for your project development.
   - A **report template** is included under the `reports/` folder to help you document your work.

### 👨‍💻 Collaboration Guidelines

6. **Daily Contributions**
   - Work collaboratively. Every team member is expected to contribute regularly.
   - Use **meaningful commit messages** and **push your work daily**.
   - Your GitHub activity (commits, issues, pull requests) will be **monitored and evaluated**.

7. **Using Python Classes**
   - You are strongly encouraged to organize your code using **Python classes** to ensure modular and reusable code.

8. **Mentor Access**
   - Mentors are **owners** of all repositories. They may review your progress or provide inline suggestions directly in the repo.

## 🪜 Creating an Issues on Github

1.  **Important** 
   - Creating an issue is important because it clearly documents a task, bug, or idea, helping the team stay organized, collaborate effectively, and track progress transparently.
