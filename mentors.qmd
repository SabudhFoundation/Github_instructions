## Instructions for Mentors


## Overview

As a Mentor, you will have administrative access to one or more GitHub repositories associated with Passion Projects on GitHub Classroom. Your role is critical in helping guide student teams, ensuring their repositories follow good practices, and supporting them through their project journey.


### üë• Setting Up & Supporting Teams

1. **Assist Students in Team Creation**  
   - Responsibility of creating passion project repository should be assigned to Group Student Leader (if not please assign responsibility) and all other students will join the group. 
   - Help students create or join sensible team names that clearly reflect their project themes.
   - Encourage use of clear, consistent naming and connected with `_` (e.g., `Traffic_Flow_Prediction`, `Crop_Yield_Predictor`, `Gait_Analyzer`, etc.).

2. **Monitor Team Repositories**  
   - Once a team accepts the GitHub Classroom assignment, a **private repository** will be created automatically.
   - As a mentor, you will be added as a **repository admin** with full privileges to guide and manage content.


### üìÅ Repository Structure & Guidance

3. **Initial Structure**  
   - A predefined directory structure and `report` folder are already included in each repo.
   - Please help students understand this structure and stick to it unless modification is essential.

4. **Custom Structure (if needed)**  
   - If a project demands a different directory structure, you may update it.
   - **Important**: In such cases, the **`README.md` must be updated** to clearly reflect the new structure and explain the purpose of each folder.
